Following libraries are required to build Summoning Wars:
OGRE >= 1.4
OIS
CEGUI >= 0.5
RakNet 2.x
freealut, openal
lua5.1
ogg, vorbis, vorbisfile

If you are lucky, all libs except Raknet may be installed via package manager (apt-get, yum, emerge, pacman, ...).
Raknet is offered here:
http://www.sumwars.org/data/Raknet2_0.tar.gz

Do not use the current Raknet version (3.x) as it is not available under GPL.

After installing the dependencies run these commands and cross your fingers:
./configure
make

If you are using OGRE >= 1.6 particle scripts need to be changed slightly. To do this run the script placed in resources/particle/ :
./resources/particle/create_ogre_1_6_particles

Currently, there is no make install, so you have to start the game in the directory where you compiled it.
