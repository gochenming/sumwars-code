Updated to use Raknet 1.51

This is a sample game I wrote using RakNet version 1.0 and MSVC 7.  It's fairly complex so I won't go over the particulars of each section.  However, most of the network related code resides in src/RakNet, DemonBattleMultiplayer.cpp, and GameState.cpp.  Look there for ideas.
