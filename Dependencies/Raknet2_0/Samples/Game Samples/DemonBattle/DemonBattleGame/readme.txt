How to play
------------------------------------------------------------------
Two castles.  Two angry greater demons.  Hordes of lesser demons.  One giant battle.

Left click to shoot.  Hold down the button to shoot farther.
Right click to summon a demon.

Demons kill each other and the enemy castle.  Fireballs hurt only demons, but are cheaper to cast and give you some mana if they kill an enemy demon.

When the level up icon appears click it or hit the middle mouse button to gain a level.  Then click on the name of the perk you want to take or hit the corresponding number key.
The perk description is at the bottom of the screen.

The game ends when one of the castles is destroyed.

Hit F2 to swap between windowed and full screen mode, and to set your resolution.
