Makefiles
======================

those new makefiles are based on the old ones by NathanH, i almost rewrote everything he done but i left some basic stuff, before compile, make sure to check the file makefile.defs, change the INCLUDE_DIR= to your include directory(generally /usr/local/include or /usr/include) and LIBS_DIR to your library directory( usually /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib ).

1-To compile raknet just type "make" on the root directory
2-To install it, log as root ( su ) and type "make install", after install it, check your /etc/ld.so.config(in debian) for the lib directories, if your LIBS_DIR directory isnt there, include it, and run ldconfig after the install process.
3-To compile the linux samples go to the linux sample directories and run make
4-To compile a program using raknet just use -I/usr/local/include(or your INCLUDE_DIR) and -lraknet for linking
